# Real-time-Stock-Price-Anomaly-Detector


Problem: Build a system that monitors stock prices and alerts when unusual patterns occur.

Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement time series analysis, moving averages, or simple LSTM for pattern detection

Critical Thinking: Define what constitutes an "anomaly" in stock movements, consider market context

Problem Solving: Handle API rate limits, missing data points, real-time processing

Modular Structure: Separate API client, data processing, anomaly detection, and alerting systems

Clear Architecture: Design pipeline from API → data validation → analysis → alert generation
